# Airline-Website

Due to this project being a college project, I cannot share the code.
However this projects code was developed entirely by me and my partner. I was responsible for the frontend and backend mostly, and he was responsible for the designs, but he also did some backend work.

### Important Features that me and my partner thought of:
* Implementing tickets, this way we could book and the ticket and it'd show us our seat, flight number, etc and what not thats normally represented on a ticket.
* Being able to view multiple flights across various times, locations, and cities.
* Having account features such as account deletion, changing password, etc.
* Changing your flight.

### Technologies Used:
-HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, MySQL


### Conclusion:
Due to time constraints, we did not get to fully add every single feature we thought of, but we tried our best and added our best feature the "ticket system", and this allowed for booking for tickets for various destinations and what not. This included all of our details that would normally be on a ticket.
