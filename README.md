# Airline-Website

Due to this project being a college project, I cannot share the code.
However this projects code was developed entirely by me and my partner. I was responsible for the frontend and backend mostly, and he was responsible for the designs, but he also did some backend work.

### Important Features that me and my partner thought of:
-Implementing tickets, this way we could book and the ticket and it'd show us our seat, flight number, etc and what not thats normally represented on a ticket.
-Being able to view multiple flights across various times, locations, and cities.
-Having account features such as account deletion, changing password, etc.
-Changing your flight.

### Technologies Used:
-HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, MySQL
