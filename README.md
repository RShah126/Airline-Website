# Airline Booking Website
This was a project we chose to do ourselves, but it was also a requirement for the courses completion. This projects code was developed entirely by me and my partner with some online help. I was responsible for the frontend and backend mostly, and he was responsible for the designs, but he also did some backend work. Since everybody made a different project within the classroom, I can share the source code. Even though the college class required us to do a project of our choice related to web development, I still considered it a personal-project, and a step up for the development of my own skills within web development.

### Important Features that me and my partner thought of:
* Implementing tickets, this way we could book and the ticket and it'd show us our seat, flight number, etc and what not thats normally represented on a ticket.
* Being able to view multiple flights across various times, locations, and cities.
* Having account features such as account deletion, changing password, etc.
* Changing your flight.

### Programming Languages and Technologies Used:
-HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, MySQL


### Conclusion:
Due to time constraints, we did not get to fully add every single feature we thought of, but we tried our best and added our best feature the "ticket system", and this allowed for booking for tickets for various destinations and what not. This included all of our details that would normally be on a ticket.
